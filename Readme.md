## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate focused on building **scalable, production-grade software systems**.

I design and develop **backend-heavy, data-intensive applications** with strong engineering principles — modular architecture, performance optimization, clean APIs, and deployment readiness.

While many of my systems leverage AI, my primary focus is on:

* Writing clean, maintainable code
* Designing scalable architectures
* Building reliable end-to-end systems
* Shipping production-ready applications
