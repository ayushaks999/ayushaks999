## 🚀 About Me

I’m **Ayush Kumar Shaw**, a Computer Science undergraduate at **NIT Durgapur**, focused on building **production-ready AI systems** that deliver real-world impact.

My work sits at the intersection of **Applied ML, Generative AI, and robust software engineering**—turning research ideas and prototypes into **scalable, observable, and maintainable systems**. I build agentic RAG platforms, multimodal ML pipelines, and data-intensive AI applications with a strong emphasis on explainability, evaluation, and deployment readiness.
